Chaos@Essay
Mihaela Eftene

Chaos@Essay is a simulation where a teacher gives a random essay question and the user needs to write on a digital loose-leaf sheet. However, because the teacher is extremely disorganized, the question keeps changing every 10 seconds! Yikes.How can the student write something in 10 seconds!? Technically that wouldn't be possible but sometimes students need to deal with horrible teachers in many ways such as this one. Having a disorganized teacher is not enough, but the software where the user writes his essay is broken. Basically, after the user writes 50 characters on the paper, the software deletes slowly what the user has written so far. Therefore, the user needs to start all over again because it will keep deleting the text (Based on the Sisyphus concept). However, there are two paths that students can choose from: Be a good student that follows the teacherâ€™s instructions while suffering, or go crazy and paint all over your essay. Hence, this simulation allows you to choose if you either want to be good or drop the paint and then hide your crimes using the liquid paper.
